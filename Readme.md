## Project Description:

The **Arduino Greenhouse Automation System** is a project aimed at automating key environmental factors in a greenhouse, such as temperature, humidity, light, and soil moisture. By integrating various sensors (DHT11, soil moisture sensor, and LDR), and controlling different systems like watering, heating, cooling, and lighting using relays, this system can help maintain optimal conditions for plant growth.

This project uses an **Arduino UNO** microcontroller to process the data from the sensors and activate relays based on predefined conditions, such as:
- Watering the plants when the soil moisture level is low.
- Activating the heating system when the temperature is too low.
- Turning on the cooling system when the temperature is too high.
- Controlling the lighting based on light intensity detected by the LDR.

The system also provides real-time feedback on temperature, humidity, and moisture levels through an **LCD screen**.
